            description: `
                The valley of Echternach has already been inhabited in the Celtic La Tène period,
                during the last centuries BCE. In the first century CE, one of the largest Roman
                villas of the northwest provinces of the Empire was constructed there.
                Another important factor for the history of the region was the imperial abbey
                <em class="emphasis-secondary">(Reichsabtei Echternach)</em>,
                founded by St Willibrord in 698. Willibrord hailed from
                Northumbria and received his training at the Irish monastery of Rathmelsigi.
                He is known as the "apostle of the Frisians" and bishop of Utrecht. He died at
                Echternach on 7 November 739. The saint was accompanied by Irish scribes, a fact
                apparent from illuminated books preserved and produced at the local scriptorium.
                A Latin manuscript from the ninth century, kept in Paris today
                (BNF Paris lat. 10290), a grammar of Priscian in insular script, contains Old Irish
                and Old Breton glosses, which belong to the oldest of their kind.
                The name <em class="emphasis-primary">Echternach</em> goes back to
                <em class="emphasis-secondary">Epternācum</em>, derived from the personal name

                The village in the French department Ardennes is situated on the western border of
                the Treveran territory, itself already being part of the polity of the Remi. During
                the Celtic period, there was a harbour and certainly a ferry service across the
                river Meuse. In the Roman period, the settlement was expanded to a
                <em class="emphasis-secondary">vicus</em> on the road from Reims to Trier (Trèves).
                The village probably appears on the famous road map, Tabula Peutingeriana, from the
                fourth century under the entry "Mosa". Approximately 3 km to the southeast of
                Mouzon, in the "Bois de Flavier", a Gallo-Roman sanctuary, a
                <em class="emphasis-secondary">Fanum</em>, was found and excavated in 1967. The
                foundation walls of the temple site have been preserved. The sanctuary had a Celtic
                predecessor as well as an earlier Roman one from the era of Augustus. A number of

                imagery. Heads from statues, probably of Juno, and of Minerva with a helmet were
                also unearthed in the area. A Roman inscription from Rue de Bétiel shows a number
                of Celtic names, including Solitumarus, Sorina, Carantillus und Carassouna. These
